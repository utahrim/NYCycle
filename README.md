[NYCycle] (https://github.com/utahrim/Re/blob/master/app/assets/images/nycycle.png)

NYCycle is a web application that uses geolocation technology to allow you to locate the nearest recycling bin in NYC. Using data on bins from NYC Open Data, the user's location from their browser, and maps from the Google Maps API, we make it easy for people to do their part to reduce, reuse, and recycle. 

Features: Find closest recycling bin to your geolocation, find closest recycling bin to a street address, render a street map that marks both your and the bin's location, render walking directions to the bin's location, render a street view of the location of the bin.
